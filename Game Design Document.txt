-- UI?! 
	-- Do we want classic style? So 1/5 general UI, 4/5 Game Screen UI?
	
-- Game Play
	-- How are tickets bought by the computer? 
		-- Probability of selling a ticket on a day by day basis. 
		-- This probability can Increase or Decrease depening on Players actions throughout?
			-- Social Media Posts
			-- Reputation (How well did other events go, fanisms)
			-- Ticket Prices? (So this can be a multiplier or be part of one)
			
			Example.
				Ticket Price of Â£65
				Reputation: Good (midtier) 
				We have done 10 Social Media posts between tickets opening and current date. 
					activites that we doing (Excitement Level: Low -> High)
					vendors that we're going to have (Need Factor: Low -> High)
					and everything is accurate  (Accuracy Factor: Every Organised -> Nothing Organised)
					HypeFactor = 
				This is expected to change
				Chance of Sale = H * R + (T/1000)
